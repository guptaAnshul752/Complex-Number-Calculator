# Complex-Number-Calculator

- A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bj, where a and b are real numbers, and j represents the imaginary unit, satisfying the equation j^2 = −1.

I’ve built a Complex Number Calculator using the knowledge of Python Classes & Objects, functions, conditional  and iterative statements, input and output statements as well as Python Data structures such as Dictionary and List.

User can select to perform operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Argument value, Conjugate value and Modulus value based on their choice.
